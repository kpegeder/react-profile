            Growing up, my favorite subject in school had to have been math. For
            me, math was logical with a right or wrong answer. As I started to
            take harder math classes, I viewed math as a puzzle. I enjoy seeing
            a problem and thinking about ways to fix them. It wasn’t until I was
            in college at Oregon State University that I learned coding. While I
            was in college, I always enjoyed when we had problems which required
            coding. Since graduation, I have found a passion for helping others
            learn or improve their knowledge. I have worked as a ski instructor
            predominating working with young children (3.5-5 yrs.), coached
            soccer to kids (8-10 yrs.), and tutor math at a community college.
            Now, it’s time for me to reset and think about what I like doing. It
            has led me to self-teaching myself how to coding a different
            language than college. In my spare time, I enjoy doing outdoor
            activities such as soccer, ultimate frisbee, skiing, and hiking.
            When I’m not outdoors, you’ll find me learning coding and listening
            to music.
